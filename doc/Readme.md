This is the customer facing simulator meaning different data is passed
in from the customer.

Namely the customer is passing us simply a token and then we turn
around and generate out the account, project, and database number
from that token.

The spinnakr-generic-simulator is for internal use.  This is the
actual data that Justin would see for his testing purposes.
